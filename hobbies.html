I love the feeling I get when I plan a new trip. It not only increases my knowledge, but also excites me. I get to learn more and more about myself and I am able to expand my horizons every time I travel.</div>

It reminds me that I can always feel like a little girl with wind in my hair. This is my way of getting rid of a bad mood and it always makes me smile!</div>

Climbing mountains has taught me patience, persistence and gratitude. All the problems in my life disappear when I'm in the mountains and life slows down a bit. After spending time around them or climbing them I always want to come back.</div>

A great book can distract me from the present and take me to another world. These few moments, though short-lived, will provide all necessary distraction from stress at life. When I  read a book, I'm completely engrossed in the story.</div>
